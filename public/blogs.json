However, these techniques often result in unqualified, uninterested leads, raising the acquisition cost without meaningful results. In contrast, the Miyabi Path focuses on intent-driven lead generation, distinguishing QLead’s methodology as a more precise and effective solution."

How does one make this distinction? How do you track leads with high intent versus those with high interest? It all boils down to the algorithms and methods used in lead generation, many of which focus on interest but fail to capture intent effectively."

        "type": "paragraph",

While leads generated through Google Ads may have a higher intent—and typically come at a higher cost compared to platforms like Meta—this doesn’t entirely solve the problem. Businesses still face the task of identifying and prioritizing high-intent leads while managing costs and resources effectively."

        "text": "For businesses, the expectation from lead generation agencies or digital marketing teams is simple: deliver high-intent leads with higher conversion rates while using fewer resources. This is because every lead requires nurturing before it converts into actual business. Lead nurturing involves time, money, and effort, often making the cost of nurturing far exceed the cost of lead generation itself. This, in turn, puts pressure on the marketing team and ultimately on the sales team. A common conflict arises between these two teams when sales figures fail to meet expectations."

The solution lies in ensuring that high-quality, high-intent leads are prioritized.
